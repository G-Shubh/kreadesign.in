When properly defining the compositional center, even in a small area, you can create an exceptional interior.

                        Layered lighting is an essential tool for creating a relaxing atmosphere in every design. We necessarily place lamps both at eye level and along the contour of the area, to control the intensity. The dinning area is created using wooden cladding with mirror niches and shelves. A comfortable dinning chairs and dark finish table top enhances the design.</p>

                    <p>Switching to kitchens that look like a single, beautifully decorated volume is actively happening now. As my experience shows, even if
                        customers like everything simple and understandable when you show a project of this kitchen, with solutions specifically for the client - the choice stops at minimalist design with integrated options. Thanks to all opening and closing systems, all modules are becoming more and more intuitive. For centuries, the ingredients of the kitchen will go into the " automatic" mode under an externally beautiful design.</p>

                    <p>Everyone has their own ideas of Puja area. And one of the easiest ways to turn the devotional area into creativity is to organize the space in a stylish and functional manner.

                        We've selected three colour options for the puja area that will increase the calmness of the environment. Grey tiles with Sanskrit shlok inscribed with brass metal accents, the puja unit with white marble and wooden texture.
                        
                        Keeping your devotional area tidy is the key to a productive day. We scrupulously design such premises, trying to provide maximum space for a closed storage and an open shelving for all the requirements, as well as maintain enough free space.</p>

                    <p>The most common mistake in bedroom interior, which will directly lead to a heavy atmosphere, is the lack of high-quality lighting. There is an opinion that the lack of daylight in the sleeping area may not be as critical as in the living room or office. We want to prove the opposite: when your bedroom has a balance of natural and artificial light, the interior becomes more beautiful and cozy, and this allows you to experiment with dark and light colours!

                        There is no universal lighting formula - only personalised
                        design is responsible for creating harmonious and individual interior with a truly comfortable atmosphere.
                        
                        Modular and magnetic track systems, direct lights by the bed, or chandeliers - you choose what you want. We will help you to organise the very perfect bedroom that you've always dreamed of!</p>

                    <p>Kitchen is not only about food, but also about comfort, coziness and inspiration.If a small area is allocated for the kitchen, light colours will visually expand the space, however the colour of both floor and ceiling must also be on a light side. For this interior, we preferred a grey-brown palette, with brass metal touch in handles and skirting, since they look strict and noble. Also by choosing smooth facades you can make your kitchen look stylish.

The rich colour scheme was supposed to be come a perfect solution for this sunny apartment.

                        Interesting interior details are exquisite partitions that zonize the space of the living room, dining room and gallery, adding uniqueness.
                        If the space of your house or apartment allows you to allocate space for a separate dining room-be sure to use it. It looks luxurious, and also a great solution for those who like to receive guests.

                    <p>Judging by the colour scheme and the material choice, you can learn a lot about the character and preferences of the owner. Love for separate spaces and level light is one of many. Moving away from hi-tech style and looking for a personalized approach, he asked our team to transform his future home.

                        Modern and spacious, this interior is warmth enough, all because of wood, leather, and calming shades of Grey. Natural stone and wood, brushed metal, modern art - this is how we create masculine interior in our unique style.</p>

                    <p>Thinking over the design of this bedroom, we tried to create an atmosphere of maximum comfort.

                        The first thing that attracts the eye is the wall panel behind the t.v and the mirrors with brass inserts add the necessary lightness. Stucco in combination with the painting, made under the wooden flooring gives the bedroom exclusivity.
                        
                        The design of the wall behind the bed also looks impressive. The luxurious texture of the natural stone is in harmony with the shade of the soft wall panel and decorative coating.
                        
                        Pay attention to the interesting design of the cabinets and the pendent lights.</p>

                        The highlight of the exterior is the stone work in a trendy massive frame. Notice how their elements elegantly echo the wooden panel design of the projections, vertical strips and the large glass window, creating a single unique design.
                        
                        The coolness of natural stone and glossy chrome is softened by the warm wooden panel of the projections.

                        The design of this dining room is mesmerizing. The main
